# Boilerplate for frontcamp mentoring program â„–4

This is basic boilerplate for deploying on Heroku.
You need just compile and move compiled files to dist directory.
If you have any another folder for compile, you can just change it in environment key.

##NOTE:

Compile your assets in dist folder, after that you can deploy in on Heroku
